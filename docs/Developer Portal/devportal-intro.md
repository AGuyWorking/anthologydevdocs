# Anthology Developer Portal

## What is the Developer Portal?
The Anthology Developer Portal is the go to site for anyone interested in developing integrations with the Anthology product portfolio. At the Portal you will find information about our REST APIs, our Developer facing documentation, and Developer Experience and Portal related announcements. 

When you create an account you will be able to register an application which is a required step for testing and releasing your integration.
## Using the Developer Portal

### Create an account

### Group Management

### Releasing Your Integration

## Developer Portal Maintenance and Releases

### Maintenance and Update Window
The Developer Portal has an _optional_ maintenance/update window scheduled every month on the Tuesday of the second week (after SaaS updates).

You may monitor the Portal maintenance/update schedule and progress at [https://status.blackboard.com](https://status.blackboard.com) and review any update release notes below.

> NOTE: Should a critical outage\* take place, we will release a detailed post-mortem on Behind the Blackboard as soon as possible - typically within four days post event. Non-critical outages will be covered using our in-Portal announcements feature only.

### Release Notes

#### 06/06/2023
Release Name: 2023.2
Features:
* **Announcement Panel**: The Announcement Panel provides Developer facing Portal, APIs, and Event information. When a new announcement is available it will be indicated via a red dot on the Announcements icon in the Portal task bar. Clicking on the Announcements icon displays released announcements - latest at the top.

* **JWT Service Integration**: As part of our Portal simplification work and in support of future LTI and API authorization projects the portal is replacing it's in-application JWT implementation with our platform-based JWT service. This has no impact on existing LTI 1.3 or REST API authorization.

* **Premium Access API**: This change provides addition Premium API information to the consuming system - e.g. Learn - and has no external facing impact.

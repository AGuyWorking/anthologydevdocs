# Welcome!

Many Anthology products offer integration capabilities through the use of REST APIs. These products are listed to the left under **REST APIs**. We expect this list to grow over time so check in frequently!

## What are REST APIs?
RESTful APIs (REpresentational State Transfer APIs) are a type of web service API that follow a set of architectural principles, known as the REST architecture. These APIs use HTTP verbs - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE - to access and manipulate resources, such as data or files, on a server.

RESTful APIs have become the most common type of web service API, used by many companies and applications to enable communication between different systems or applications.

## Why are REST APIs important?
There are several reasons why RESTful APIs are important:

**Interoperability**: RESTful APIs enable interoperability between different systems and programming languages. This means that applications built on different platforms or programming languages can communicate with each other easily using a common protocol.

**Ease of development**: Applications using RESTful APIs are easy to develop because REST APIs use standard HTTP methods and have a well-defined structure. This makes them easy to understand and implement, reducing the time and cost of development.

**Scalability**: RESTful APIs are highly scalable because they use HTTP as their underlying protocol, which is a widely adopted protocol for web communication. This allows for easy load balancing and horizontal scaling of services.

**Security**: RESTful APIs can be secured using various authentication mechanisms such as OAuth and SSL/TLS. This ensures that the data being transmitted is secure and only accessible to authorized users.

Overall, RESTful APIs provide a simple and effective way to expose data and services over the web, making them an important tool for modern software development.

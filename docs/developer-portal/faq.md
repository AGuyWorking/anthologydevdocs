## How do I change the ownership of my application?

This has happened many, many times. Sometimes a person is the owner of the application and not a group, and when that person leaves the company... well... the application will continue under that person's email. You can follow this video to change the ownership. Please keep in mind we are unable to make changes in the backend of any ownership of any application.
